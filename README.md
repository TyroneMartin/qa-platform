# DevQ&A Platform

A full-stack Question & Answer platform built with Angular and Node.js/Express, similar to Stack Overflow. This project was created as a final project for WDD430 Full-Stack Development class.

## Project Structure

This project has a **custom setup** with separate frontend and backend servers:

```
qa-platform/
â”œâ”€â”€ frontend/          # Angular application (port 4200)
â”œâ”€â”€ backend/           # Node.js/Express API (port 3000)
â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

## Development Setup

**Important:** This project requires starting BOTH backend and frontend servers separately.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18+ recommended)
- MongoDB (local installation or MongoDB Atlas)
- Angular CLI (`npm install -g @angular/cli`)

### 1. Backend Setup

```bash
# Navigate to backend directory
cd backend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create .env file with your MongoDB connection
echo "MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/qa-platform" > .env

# Start the backend server
npm run dev
```

The backend server will run on `http://localhost:3000`

### 2. Frontend Setup

```bash
# Navigate to frontend directory (in a new terminal)
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the Angular development server
ng serve
```

The frontend application will run on `http://localhost:4200`

### 3. Verify Setup

- Backend API: `http://localhost:3000/api/health`
- Frontend App: `http://localhost:4200`
- API Endpoint: `http://localhost:3000/api/questions`

##  Test Data Setup

For testing purposes, you can populate the database with sample questions and answers.

##  Available Scripts

### Backend Scripts
```bash
npm run dev          # Start development server with nodemon
npm start           # Start production server
```

### Frontend Scripts
```bash
ng serve            # Start development server
ng build            # Build for production
ng test             # Run unit tests
ng e2e              # Run end-to-end tests
```
